This project uses a **relational database with 9 interconnected tables**:
- `brands`, `categories`, `customers`, `order_items`, `orders`, `products`, `staffs`, `stocks`, and `stores`.

Using **PostgreSQL**, I wrote 15+ analytical SQL queries that explore:
- 🏩 Customer behavior & purchase patterns  
- 📦 Product pricing & category trends  
- 🧑‍💼 Staff-wise order handling  
- 🏬 Store-wise performance & inventory value  
- 📈 Monthly order trends & product demand

### 🛠️ SQL Concepts Used

- INNER & OUTER JOINS  
- Aggregate Functions (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, `MAX`, etc.)  
- Subqueries & CTEs  
- `CASE` statements  
- `IS NULL`, `NOT IN`, `EXISTS`, `DISTINCT`  
- Window Functions (`RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`)
